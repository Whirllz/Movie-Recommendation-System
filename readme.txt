Motivation : 
At times when we want to recommend a movie to one of our friends we somehow do not remember the name of the movie. Rather, something sticks with us about the movie, be it the actor or character etc. Therefore, we thought if the user queries the actor(s) or character(s) or title or story of the movie, then we can output the most probable movie from the dataset, with all its details in the dataset to the user.Adding to that, movies that are still relevant to the search query are also given with their names.
Furthermore, this tool can also be used to recommend the movie to the user query according to the relevant search the user makes, to reccomend user certain similar kind of movies.(by Genre, Actor(s), Character(s), StoryLine etc.)
